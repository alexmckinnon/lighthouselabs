## Overview

Welcome to the Lighthouse Labs 21-Day Coding Challenge! Over the next 21 days you will be responsible for managing the Lighthouse9000â„¢ and making sure it runs as smoothly as possible. As the Lighthouse operator, you will need to solve daily coding challenges to power the lighthouse and keep passing ships (and their passengers) safe.

## Challenges

Write a function called gridSize() that will tell you the size of your grid in the format width x height.

### Day 2

Write a new function called totalCells() which will return the total number of cells in your grid.

### Day 3

Write a function called lightCell() that takes in the coordinates in the form of 'A3' or 'J9' and returns the contents of that specific cell.

### Day 4

Write a function called isRock() which will take in a coordinate in the form of 'C7' and return a true or a false boolean value depending on whether there is a rock in that cell or not.

### Day 5

Write a function called isCurrent() which will take in a coordinate in the form of 'A4' and return a true or a false boolean value depending on whether there is a strong current in that cell or not.

### Day 6

Write a function named lightRow() that takes in the number of the row and returns the contents.

### Day 7

Write a function called lightColumn() that takes in the letter of the column from the grid, and returns an array that is the contents of that grid column.
